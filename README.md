The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" project is designed to streamline bus travel data collection, 
filtering, and visualization using a combination of powerful Python libraries and tools. 
This system automates the extraction of detailed information from Redbus (such as bus schedules, pricing, routes, and seat availability), processes it for analysis,
through a Streamlit application.




Tools and Technologies

●	Python: For scripting and data manipulation.

●	Selenium: For web scraping.

●	MySQL: For data storage.

●	Streamlit: For creating the web application.

●	Visual studio:  For development and testing.


Key Features 

Web Scraping with Selenium:
Extract data such as routes, schedules, prices, seat availability, ratings, and operator details.
Handle dynamic content loading and implement delays or retries for robustness.
Respect legal and ethical considerations (e.g., adhere to website terms of service).

Data Storage and Management:
Store the scraped data in a structured format using databases like mysql, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite.
Use pandas for data cleaning and transformation.

Streamlit Interface:
Provide an intuitive interface for users to filter data based on specific criteria such as price, availability, ratings, or time slots.
Include visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and maps for insights.

Data Analysis and Insights:
Summarize the data to identify trends (e.g., peak travel times, popular routes).
Allow users to download reports in CSV or Excel format.


Few Use Cases
Travel Operators: Optimize routes and pricing strategies.
Passengers: Find the best travel options based on preferences.
Analysts: Study travel patterns and forecast demand.
